Have you been to Alaska? I'm Christina. I've left several questiones for you to think about in this paragraph. I grow up in Beijing, China but have spent 1/3 of my time(before 2021) in Fremont, CA, USA. I love Mathematics, Computer Science and Anthropology(high key)!. I dream to the one at the intersection of science, people, culture and whatever I'm passionate about...(you will hear intersection from me a lot like now). An social media fan bc it's easy to share things or spread things. So learn about my world on [insta](https://www.instagram.com/bsflll/)! 

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
