Have you been to Alaska? I'm Christina :sparkles: . I've left several questiones for you to think about in this paragraph :emoji-flirt: . I grow up in Beijing, China but have spent one third of my time(before 2021(COVID!)) in Fremont, CA, USA. I love `Mathematics`, `Computer Science` and `Anthropology`(high key)! Something very important for me is `Musical` performing, `Entrepreneurship`, `Volunteering`, and my Non-profit organization [intersection4all](https://www.instagram.com/intersection4all/). What's your dream? Who do you care about? :light: I dream to be someone at the intersection of science, people, culture and whatever I'm passionate about...(you will hear the word intersection from me a lot like now). This girl is a social media fan because she thinks it's easy to share things or spread things. So learn about my world on [insta](https://www.instagram.com/bsflll/) or possibly on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiBODtJg9TkggMlI0O8_Jow)! 


Some fun facts: I have two twins sisters :heart: ; I changed from a dog person to a cat person three years ago :cat: ; Recently addicted to Macaron :cake: ; Enjoy being a young person(idk even what i mean here); My next destination is Malta for field research :water: ; I hope I can write a book or an article without using "I".
