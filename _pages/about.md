Have you been to Alaska? I'm Christina. I've left several questiones for you to think about in this paragraph. I grow up in Beijing, China but have spent one third of my time(before 2021(COVID!)) in Fremont, CA, USA. I love `Mathematics`, `Computer Science` and `Anthropology`(high key)! Something very important for me is `Musical` performing, `Entrepreneurship`, `Volunteering`, and my Non-profit organization [intersection4all](https://www.instagram.com/intersection4all/). What's your dream? Who do you care about? I dream to be someone at the intersection of science, people, culture and whatever I'm passionate about...(you will hear the word intersection from me a lot like now). This girl is a social media fan because she thinks it's easy to share things or spread things. So learn about my world on [insta](https://www.instagram.com/bsflll/) or possibly on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiBODtJg9TkggMlI0O8_Jow)! 

You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` 
property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
